            <p><strong>Astronomy</strong> is a natural science that studies celestial objects and the phenomena that occur in the cosmos. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and their overall evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids, asteroids, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole!

      <h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
      <div class="flexTwo">
        <p>Astronomy (from the Greek ἀστρονομία from ἄστρον astron, "star" and -νομία -nomia from νόμος nomos, "law" or "culture") means "law of the stars" (or "culture of the stars" depending on the translation). Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects.[2] Although the two fields share a common origin, they are now entirely distinct.[3]</p>

        <h3>Use of terms "astronomy" and "astrophysics"</h3>
        <p>"Astronomy" and "astrophysics" are synonyms.[4][5][6] Based on strict dictionary definitions, "astronomy" refers to "the study of objects and matter outside the Earth's atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties",[7] while "astrophysics" refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with "the behavior, physical properties, and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena".[8]

      <h3>Ancient Times</h3>
      <p>In early historic times, astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that may have had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.[10]</p>

      <div class="flexOne">
      <h3>Middle Ages</h3>
      <p>Medieval Europe housed a number of important astronomers. Richard of Wallingford (1292–1336) made major contributions to astronomy and horology, including the invention of the first astronomical clock, the Rectangulus which allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astronomical bodies, as well as an equatorium called the Albion which could be used for astronomical calculations such as lunar, solar and planetary longitudes and could predict eclipses.</p>

      <h2 id="Observational">Observational Astronomy</h2>
  
      <p>The main source of information about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light, or more generally electromagnetic radiation. Observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the electromagnetic spectrum on which the observations are made.</p>
     
      <div class="flexOne">
      <h3 id="Radio">Radio Astronomy</h3>
      <p>Radio astronomy uses radiation with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter, outside the visible range.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flexOne">

      <h3 id="Infrared">Infrared Astronomy</h3>
      <p>Infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flexOne">

      <h3 id="Optical">Optical Astronomy</h3>
      <p>Historically, optical astronomy, which has been also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy.</p>

      <h3 id="Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet Astronomy</h3>
      <p>Ultraviolet astronomy employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200 Å (10 to 320 nm).</p>

<div class="flexOne">
      <h3 id="Xray">X-Ray<br>Astronomy</h3>
      <p>X-ray astronomy uses X-ray wavelengths.</p>

<div class="flexOne">
      <h3>Gamma Ray Astronomy</h3>
      <p>Gamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. </p>
